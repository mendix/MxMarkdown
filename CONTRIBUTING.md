# App Store GitHub Guidelines

We like to work with our community and encourage you to create and contribute using pull requests!

## Getting started

- Make sure you have a (GitHub account)[https://github.com/join]
- Make sure you have a (Mendix account)[https://home.mendix.com/]
- Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making changes to an existing repository

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work on your fork.
-   This is usually the repository's master branch.
-   To quickly create a topic branch based on master; git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master. Please avoid working directly on the master branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.
- Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
- Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the appropriate repository in the Mendix organization.
-   Mention the id's for any issues that are fixed by the changes (Closing issues with Pull Requests)[https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages#closing-issues-with-pull-requests]
- After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks will may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
